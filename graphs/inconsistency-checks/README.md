This folder has the graphs used to test the consistency of training. The folder predicted-graphs has graphs comparing the predicted output to the desired output for certain training iterations. For this test the number of cells was kept 50. Also the error variation files can be seen in the folder error-graphs.

The error graphs were generated for two different training iterations with same starting weights. The graphs are identical. The source files for these graphs are in the results/inconsistency-checks folder.
