This folder has all the graphs for the tests made on Irregular time series. The folder predicted-graphs has the graphs for different cell sizes. All tests were made on 60 points being sampled from a 400 point sine curve. The tested cell states were 5 to 25 with an interval of 5.


The error-graphs folder has the training error variation with training graphs. They also contain the raw files which were used to create these graphs for future use.
